## WPF and .NET specific Powershell Module

As of now, this is not a module, but rather a collection of functions and scripts of common processes that we need to do as part of the WPF team activities.
The aim of the module is to simplify the tasks like : branching-branding, community test pass, debugging, etc. simpler and less time consuming for the developers.
